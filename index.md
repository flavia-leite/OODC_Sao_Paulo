# The OODC and its "Robin Hood" approach to city building
by Flávia Leite

### INTRODUCTION
The **Outorga Onerosa do Direito de Construir (OODC)** - or the onerous grant of the right to build - is one of Brazil's main instruments of municipal urban planning. The OODC was brought in by the 2001 Statute of the City (Estatuto da Cidade), the national law regulating the Brazilian Constitution's articles on urban policy. The OODC regulates the payment by developers of additional building rights - those who want to build above a specific Floor Area Ratio (FAR) have to pay the OODC to a municipality.

The resources generated by the OODC in a city are deposited into a reserve fund used to provide urban improvements of social interest across this municipality. The OODC's basic principle is that funds captured in the most expensive regions of a city should be redistributed to lower-income areas, benefiting the common interest. This "Robin Hood" approach to city building was conceived by the Statute of the City, which is profoundly driven by equity principles. 

Although regulated at the national level in 2001, the OODC is still a poorly disseminated instrument among Brazilian cities. Currently, only 40% of the more than 5 thousand Brazilian municipalities have specific legislation concerning the use of the OODC(IBGE, 2018). The map below shows (_click on the image to see the interactive map!_) the status of the OODC use in Brazil's 26 State capitals and the Federal District (Brazília). Out of the 27 cities, 20 have specific legislation codifying the implementation of the OODC, but only 16 of them implement the instrument.

### SÃO PAULO'S CONTEXT
The OODC was established in São Paulo in 2002 by the city's Strategic Master Plan. Since then, the instrument has raised more than R$ 4.4 billion (around $0.9 billion) in about 3.5 thousand real estate projects. The annual amount generated by the OODC is considered modest compared to other municipal revenue sources[^1]. Still, the OODC is valued by the São Paulo municipality as a funding source directly applicable to urban improvements (Friendly, 2017). In São Paulo, OODC revenues are allocated to the **Urban Development Fund (FUNDURB)** and earmarked to finance social housing, infrastructure, and other projects of social interest to the community. 

[^1]: As a matter of comparison, São Paulo's budget in 2020 was R$69 billion, while the OODC revenue for that year was R$ 5.4 million.

REVENUE:

The two charts below show  OODC revenues and spending over the years. Due to limited data availability, the charts present figures only from 2013 to 2020. During this period, R$ 2.8 billion ($0.6 billion) were raised by the OODC. Changes made to São Paulo's master plan in 2014 altered the standardized formula used to calculate the charge levied on developers via the ODDC, limiting revenue generation in the first years. Later, between 2019 and 2020, lower interest rates benefited the real estate market, boosting OODC revenues.

SPENDING:

Between 2013 and 2020, FUNDURB spending amounted to R$2.2billion ($0.44 billion) - 40% of that amount was disbursed in the last two years. 
As already mentioned, OODC funds are not a significant municipal revenue source. Still, this resource can have substantial impacts depending on how it is allocated. For example, between 2013 and 2015, OODC revenues contributed to a 10% increase in the budget of the Subprefeituras Department and a 7% growth in the Culture Department's budget, representing a significant revenue gain for these entities (Santoro et al, 2016).

### METHODOLOGY
In São Paulo, OODC revenues have a **redistributive purpose**; revenues collected in the most developed parts of the city should be spent on the most vulnerable areas. Given this redistributive goal, this project aims to answer the following set of questions: 
1. Where have OODC revenues been raised?
2. Have OODC revenues been spent in areas with higher demand for infrastructure?
3. What type of public projects have been funded with OODC revenues? 

To answer these questions, I explore some datasets available at:
* [SP’s Master Plan monitoring webpage](https://monitoramentopde.gestaourbana.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/) 
* [IBGE – 2010 Brazilian Census- API](https://www.ibge.gov.br/en/home-eng.html)
* [IBGE - 2018 “Pesquisa de  Informações  Básicas  Municipais”](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/educacao/10586-pesquisa-de-informacoes-basicas-municipais.html?=&t=resultados)


For the purposes of this study, I only utilized OODC data from 2013 to 2020, the timeframe available on the city of São Paulo's website. 
To analyze the OODC revenue/spending I imported all of the data as .csv files and used python and pandas to join appropriate datasets and clean up each dataframe to provide consistent information on the following fields: latitude, longitude, OODC paid by each project, amount invested in each district. For the specific case of data on OODC housing spending (last map), I had to geolocate addresses, using the Geopy python library.

I also used the 2010 census of IBGE, to get data on income and household characteristics. I downloaded shp. files of census tracks and district boundaries from their website. I downloaded the income and household data from the API of [Base dos dados](https://basedosdados.github.io/mais/api_reference_python/), a website that provides cleaned IBGE dataframes. It is worth noting that since I worked with data from Brazil, I had to transform some numbers. In the US, cents are separated by a decimal point, and thousands are separated by a comma. But in Brazil, it is the opposite. I also had to translate most of the table headings. Finally, to create the first interactive map I utilized .csv files available on IBGE's Municipal survey webpage.

### REVENUE AND SPENDING

WHERE WERE OODC REVENUES RAISED?

The collection of OODC has not been homogeneous throughout the city. The map below shows the percentage of the population living in favelas in each city district and real estate projects (red dots) that paid OODC between 2013 and 2020. Most of these projects are located in the southwest part of the city, where high-income households live, and the real estate market concentrates its activities.

WHERE WERE OODC FUNDS SPENT?

FUNDURB Spending has not been uniform either. As the map below shows, between 2013 and 2020, spending was concentrated in the São Paulo's historic center and in some peripheral districts in the South and East parts of the city, where many low-income households live. Still, the amount spent in many poor communities (light pink) was very low, ranging between R$5millionn ($1 million) and R$17million ($3.4 million). This low spending raises questions about the OODC impact on some districts.

Another way of looking at the same question is observing the map below. It shows the ratio of FUNDURB or OODC spending to OODC revenues by District. A percentage higher than one means that the amount spent (invested) in a district was higher than the amount of OODC revenues it generated. Considering the OODC redistributive purposes, we expect to see higher ratios in low-income districts (predominantly located in the periphery and the city's historic center) and lower ratios in wealthier areas. And that is what we find!

<br>
### FUNDURB SPENDING: BREAKDOWN BY CATEGORY
The pie chart below shows the breakdown of FUNDURB's spending by type of project funded between 2013 and 2020. During this period, more than 2/3 of the funds were spent on housing (43% of the total) and transportation (29% of the total). Santoro et al. (2016) highlight that increasing the share of funds spent on these two types of projects was a demand of civil society groups, which had a strong involvement in drafting São Paulo's new master plan in 2014. The investment in housing encompasses social housing projects, land acquisition, land tenure regularization, and slum upgrading initiatives. Transportation projects entail bus and bicycle lanes and sidewalk and road improvements.

A closer look at the breakdown of FUNDURB's spending according to district type shows a more heterogeneous picture. Spending on Central districts, with few parks and a deteriorated housing stock, was concentrated on green spaces (36%) and social housing (39%). In low-income districts, FUNDURB spending was targeted at housing (47%), transportation (27%), and Water and sanitation projects (19%). In upper-middle-class districts, on the other hand, more than half of spending went to transportation projects.

### FUNDURB SPENDING: HOUSING
Providing an even more detailed look at the FUNDURB spending, we can see how OODC revenues have been used to fund social housing-related investments (the largest share of FUNDURB spending). As described above, not all of this investment refers to housing projects; most relate to acquiring land to develop social housing, regularizing land tenure, and upgrading favelas. The map below (_click on the image to see the interactive map!_) shows how these investments are spread throughout the city and the average income per household per census tract (the smallest territorial unity for which data are available). Most social housing-related investments are in the east side of the city (the lowest income region of São Paulo that benefits from land regularization projects) and in the southwest region (the highest income region where the city plans to bring more social housing).

### CONCLUSION
This brief analysis tried to show whether the OODC managed to accomplish its central goal of trading development rights for community benefits. Overall, the OODC managed to capture funds in the wealthiest districts and apply them in the city's poorest areas, accomplishing its "Robin Hood" goals. In terms of spending, most of it was concentrated in peripheral districts and in the historic city center, areas that have a strong need for public investment. The analysis showed that ODDC spending was unequal within low-income districts. The amount spent on some low-income communities between 2013 and 2020 was meager, with many of those districts received less than R$20million ($4 million), an amount insufficient to bring meaningful urban investments. Still, we can say that generally, FUNDURB spending in low-income districts was larger than OODC revenues raised. Finally, the OODC spending focus on housing and transportation shows that the instrument is being implemented in line with the demand of civil society.

This project could have benefited from more granular data on OODC revenues and expenditures. While it was possible to geolocate addresses for FUNDURB housing spending, the same was not valid for other spending categories since addresses were poorly formatted or did not exist. If the city could provide georeferenced information for FUNDURB spending, we would better understand the instrument's redistributive potential.  Additionally, had this data been available on a larger time frame, the study may have shed more light on how OODC spending varied over time.
