# Is the OODC achieving its geographic redistributive purposes?
by Flávia Leite


### INTRODUCTION
The **Outorga Onerosa do Direito de Construir (OODC)** - or the onerous grant of the right to build - is one of Brazil's main instruments of  municipal urban planning. The OODC was brought in by the 2001 Statute of the City (Estatuto da Cidade), the national law regulating the Brazilian Constitution’s articles on urban policy.The OODC regulates the payment by Developers of additional building rights. The resources generated with the OODC in each city are deposited into a reserve fund used to provide urban improvements of social interest across the municipality.


Although regulated at the national level in 2001, the OODC is still a poorly disseminated instrument among Brazilian cities. Currently, only 40% of the more than 5 thousand Brazilian municipalities have a specific legislation concerning the use of the OODC(IBGE, 2018). The map below shows the status of the OODC use in Brazil's 26 State capitals and the Federal District (Brazília). Out of the 27 cities, 20 have specific legislation codifying the implementation of the OODC, but **only 16 of them implement the instrument**.

### SÃO PAULO'S CONTEXT
The OODC was established in São Paulo in 2002 by the city’s Strategic Master Plan. Since then the instrument have raised more than R$ 4.4 billion (around $0.9 billion), in about 3.5 thousand real estate projects. The anual amount generated by the OODC is considered modest, compared to other municipal revenue sources[^1]. Still, OODC is valued by the São Paulo municipality as a source of funding directly applicable to urban improvements (Friendly, 2017). In São Paulo, OODC revenues are allocated to the **Urban Development Fund (FUNDURB)** and earmarked to finance social housing, infrastructure, and other urban improvements of social interest to the community. 

[^1]: As a matter of comparison, São Paulo's budget in 2020 was R$69 billion, while the OODC revenue for that year was R$ 5.4 million.

_Revenue_:

The two charts below show  OODC revenues and spending over the years. Due to limited data availability, the charts present figures only from 2013 to 2020. During this time period **R$ 2.8 billion ($0.6 billion) were raised by the OODC**. Between 2019 and 2020, lower interest rates impacted positively the real estate market, boosting OODC revenues. Also, changes made to São Paulo's master plan in 2014, altered the standardized formula used to calculate the charge levied on developers via the ODDC, increasing revenue generation.

_Spending_:

Between 2013 and 2020, **R$2.2billion ($0.44 billion) of OODC revenues were spent**. Of that amount 40% was paid out in the last two years. 
As already mentioned, OODC funds are not a key municipal revenue source.  Still, this money can have important impacts depending on how they are allocated. For example, between 2013 and 2015, OODC revenues contributed to a 10% increase in the budget of the Subprefeituras Department, and a 7% growth in the Culture Department's budget,representing a significant revenue increase for this entities (Friendly, 2017).

### METHODOLOGY
In São Paulo, OODC revenues have a **redistributive purpose**; revenues collected in the most developed parts of the city should be spent on the most vulnerable areas. Given this redistributive objective, my project aims to answer the following set of questions: 
* Q1. Where are OODC revenues raised?
* Q2. Have OODC revenues been spent in areas with higher demand for infrastructure?
* Q3. What type of public projects were funded with OODC revenues? 

To answer these questions, I explore some datasets available at:
* [SP’s Master Plan monitoring webpage](https://monitoramentopde.gestaourbana.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/) 
* [IBGE – 2010 Brazilian Census- API](https://www.ibge.gov.br/en/home-eng.html)

### REVENUE AND SPENDING


_Where were OODC revenues raised?_

The collection of OODC has not been homogeneous throughout the city. The map below shows, the percentage of population living in favelas in each city district, as well as real estate projects (red dots) that paid OODC between 2013 and 2020. Most of these projects are located in the **southweast part of the city**, where high-income households live and the real estate market concentrates its activities.

_Where were the OODC funds spent?_
 
Spending of OODC funds has not been uniform either. As the map below shows, between 2013 and 2020, spending was concentrated in the São Paulo's historic center and in some peripheral districts in the **South and East part of the city**, where low-income households are concentrated. Still, the amount spent in many poor districts was very low, ranging between $5million and $17million, corresponding to the amount spent on many high-income areas in the southweast region.

Another way of looking at the same question, is by observing the map below. This map shows the ratio of OODC spending to OODC revenues by District. A ratio higher than one means that a district receive more OODC spending than what it generated. Considering the OODC redistributive purposes, we expect to see **higher ratios in low-income districts** (predominantly located in the periphery and in the city's historic center). And that is what we found!

### OODC SPENDING: BREAKDOWN
The pie chart below shows the breakdown of OODC spending by type of project funded between 2013 and 2020. During this time period more than **2/3 of the funds were spent on housing (43% of total) and transportation (29% of total)**. Santoro et al. (2016) highlight that increasing the share of funds spent on these two types of projects was a demand of civil society groups, which had a strong involvement in drafting São Paulo's new master plan in 2014. The investment on housing encompasses not only social housing projects, but also the acquisition of land to develop social housing, land tenure regularization and slum upgrading initiatives. Transportation projects entail bus and bicycle lanes, sidewalk and road improvements.

A closer look at the breakdown of OODC spending according to district type, shows a more heterogenous picture. Spending on Central districts, areas with virtually no parks an deteriorated housing stock, was concentrated on green spaces (36%) and social housing (39%). Similarly, in low-income districts, where OODC spending was directed to housing (47%), transportation (27%) and Water and sanitation projecs (19%).In upper-middle class districts, on the other hand, more than half of spending was allocated to transportation projects.

<br>
### OODC SPENDING: HOUSING
Providing an even more detailed look at the OODC spending, we can see how FUNDURB revenues have been used to fund social housing-related investments. As described above, not all of this investment refer to housing projects, most of them are actually related to the acquisition of land to develop social housing, land tenure regularization and slum upgrading initiatives. The map below (_interactive map you can click on it!_) shows how these investments are spread troughout the city and what is the average income per household per census tracts (the smallest territorial unity for which data are available). The majority of social housing-related investments are on the east side of the city, the lowest income region of São Paulo, and on the southweast region, the highest income region were the municipality intends to bring more social housing and also where the largest favela of the city (Paraisópolis) is located.

### CONCLUSION

In line with the rationale that the community benefits in São Paulo are located throughout the city such that the entire city gains from the benefits of the urbanization process. Indeed, FUNDURB resources were prioritized in the periphery of the city (Nobre 2016). As a recent blog post notes, “the prefeitura not only broadens the amount of resources to invest in the city, but also allows a better spatial distribution of infrastructure investments” (Santoro et al. 2016). In a general sense, the application of OODC and the use of FUNDURB have captured funds in the most expensive regions of the city, and applied those funds in the poorest regions in a “Robin Hood” approach to city building.
