# Is the OODC achieving its geographic redistributive purposes?
by Flávia Leite

## INTRODUCTION

## QUESTIONS AND METHODOLOGY
In São Paulo, OODC revenues are allocated to the **Urban Development Fund (FUNDURB)** and earmarked to finance social housing, infrastructure, and other investments across the city. 
OODC revenues have a **redistributive purpose**; revenues collected in the most developed parts of the city should be spent on the most vulnerable areas. 

Given its redistributive objectives, my project aims to answer the following set of questions: 
* Q1. Which parts of the city generated more OODC revenue?
* Q2. Have OODC revenues been spent on areas with higher demand for infrastructure?
* Q3. What type of public projects were funded with OODC revenues? 

To answer these questions, I am going to explore the following datasets:
* [SP’s Urban Development Fund’s revenue](https://monitoramentopde.gestaourbana.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/) 
* SP’s Urban Development Fund's capital spending
* SP’s Demographic data (district level) – Brazilian Census
